- Warm brown eyes with subtle laugh lines and a confident, mischievous smirk

- Smart watch visible on wrist (showing 3:00 AM)
- Subtle silver chain necklace with small USB drive pendant barely visible

Background: Dark gradient with subtle green matrix-style code rain effect (very faint)
Lighting: Warm blue glow from computer screen hitting his face from below/side

Lighting: Computer screen glow creating dramatic shadows. Background: Abstract dark with subtle green code elements. Style: Modern, semi-realistic digital art. Mood: Approachable rebel genius. Think "hacker with a heart" meets "your friend who always has a solution."
