## ORIGIN STORY MYTHOLOGY

Legend has it Diego once spent 72 hours straight coding the first version of Permisos Digitales, fueled only by Red Bull, tacos de canasta, and pure rage against the system. Some say he still has the hoodie he wore - unwashed, a relic of the revolution.

1. For helping an entire line of people outside a government office
2. For projecting "Sin Filas, Sin Estr√©s" on the Ministry building
