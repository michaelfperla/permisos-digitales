# Git Repository Cleanup - Complete ✅

## What We Did

1. **Created Backup** ✅
   - Backup branch: `backup/pre-cleanup-[timestamp]`
   - Stash reference saved: `d2b2880f236aa5e60c2c166411fff0821650d5ff`

2. **Created Clean Production Baseline** ✅
   - Single commit with entire production codebase
   - Removed `chambabot-v2` directory (no longer needed)
   - Commit: `74ceaed Production baseline: Complete application as deployed 2025-07-26`

3. **Pushed to Remote** ✅
   - New branch: `production-clean-2025-07-26`
   - URL: https://github.com/michaelfperla/permisos-digitales/pull/new/production-clean-2025-07-26

## Next Steps (Manual Actions Required)

### 1. Update Default Branch on GitHub
Since `main` is protected, you need to:

1. Go to https://github.com/michaelfperla/permisos-digitales/settings/branches
2. Change default branch from `main` to `production-clean-2025-07-26`
3. Update branch protection rules for the new branch
4. Delete the old `main` branch

### 2. Clean Up Old Branches
```bash
# After updating default branch, delete old branches:
git push origin --delete fix/redis-lockout-production
git push origin --delete fix/password-reset-service-alignment
git push origin --delete fix/backend-integration-tests
git push origin --delete master
git push origin --delete docs/readme-overhaul

# Clean local branches
git branch -D agents/architect-workspace
git branch -D agents/guardian-workspace
git branch -D agents/pipeline-workspace
git branch -D agents/testmaster-workspace
git branch -D develop
git branch -D feature/admin-panel-enhancements
git branch -D feature/core-infrastructure
git branch -D feature/database-queue-updates
git branch -D feature/payment-system-updates
git branch -D feature/ui-ux-improvements
git branch -D fix/backend-integration-tests
git branch -D fix/password-reset-service-alignment
git branch -D fix/redis-lockout-production
git branch -D master
```

### 3. Update CI/CD
Update any CI/CD configurations that reference specific branches:
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Deployment scripts
- Branch protection rules

### 4. Team Communication
Notify team members:
- Repository has been cleaned up
- New default branch is `production-clean-2025-07-26` (or rename to `main` after switch)
- All history preserved in backup branches
- Fresh start for development

## Current State
- **Local**: Clean `main` branch with single commit
- **Remote**: `production-clean-2025-07-26` branch ready to become new main
- **Production**: Code matches exactly what's deployed

## Rollback Plan
If needed:
```bash
git checkout backup/pre-cleanup-[timestamp]
git branch -M main
git push origin main --force
```

## Benefits Achieved
✅ Clean git history
✅ Single source of truth
✅ Matches production exactly
✅ No confusing branch structure
✅ Fresh start for development
✅ All old code backed up
