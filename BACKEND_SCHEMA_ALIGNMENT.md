# Backend Schema Alignment

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to align the password-reset.service.js implementation with the actual database schema for the password_reset_tokens table.

## Issue Identified

The database schema in the migration file (migrations/20240414_add_password_reset_tokens.sql) defines the password_reset_tokens table with a `used_at TIMESTAMPTZ` column to track when a token was used. However, there were still references to a `used` boolean field in the unit tests.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Unit Tests

The service code was already correctly using `used_at` instead of `used`, but the unit tests still had references to the `used` boolean field. We updated the unit tests to match the implementation:

1. Changed SQL query expectations:
```javascript
// Before
expect(db.query).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  expect.stringContaining('SELECT user_id, expires_at, used'),
  [token]
);

// After
expect(db.query).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  expect.stringContaining('SELECT user_id, expires_at, used_at'),
  [token]
);
```

2. Updated mock responses:
```javascript
// Before
db.query.mockResolvedValueOnce({
  rows: [{ user_id: userId, expires_at: expiresAt, used: false }],
  rowCount: 1
});

// After
db.query.mockResolvedValueOnce({
  rows: [{ user_id: userId, expires_at: expiresAt, used_at: null }],
  rowCount: 1
});
```

## Testing

All unit tests for the password-reset.service.js file were updated and are now passing. The changes ensure that the tests correctly match the service code, which was already properly using the `used_at` timestamp field as defined in the database schema.

## Code Coverage

After running the coverage report, we found that the password-reset.service.js file has a high coverage rate of 96.11%, which is well above the target of 75-80%. The few uncovered lines are related to error handling, which is acceptable.

## Conclusion

This alignment ensures that the password reset service tests correctly match the implementation, which was already properly using the `used_at` timestamp field as defined in the database schema. All tests are now passing, confirming that the implementation is working correctly.
